At this point, you're probably wondering: "what
on earth is wrong with this 3DS"?

The thing is, this 3DS is modded.

Right now, this 3DS is running an exploit known
as ARM9 Loader Hax, best known as A9LH.  To 
simplify it, this 3DS has custom files writt-
en to its NAND chip, causing the 3DS to boot
unsigned code directly at boot.  

Allowing the 3DS to run unsigned code enables
Custom Firmware, or CFW.  CFWs essentially
load the 3DS's home menu with signature
checks disabled, allowing custom code (as well
as pirated material) to be run on the 3DS.
CFW is what allows this program, among others,
to run on the 3DS.

tl;dr This 3DS is modded, allowing custom
programs, as well as pirated games to be
run on it.

If this is not your 3DS, and you have no prior
knowledge of 3DS hacking, it is advised not to
run any unfamiliar programs, as doing so could
tamper the 3DS against its owner's wishes,
and/or possibly brick the system (render it 
unusable).  If this 3DS is lost, try to return
it to its original owner.

If this is your 3DS, remember to run frequent
NAND backups.  This can be achieved through
programs like EmuNAND9 and Hourglass9, which
are, more likely than not, already on this
system and can be activated by pressing down
a button on boot.  The button corresponding
to these programs is probably outlined on your
CFW's splash screen.  If you are still
confused, contact the person who installed
A9LH on your system.

At this point, you're probably wondering: "what
on earth is wrong with this 3DS"?

The thing is, this 3DS is modded.

This 3DS is running a firmware version lower
than or at 9.2, meaning that the NAND chip
on the 3DS has data for version 9.2 of
the 3DS's operating system.  Versions 9.2
of the 3DS's firmware contain exploits,
including exploits that allow unsigned code
to be run on the 3DS, as well as kernel
exploits.

Kernel exploits on the 3DS allow for
Custom Firmware, or CFW.  CFWs essentially
load the 3DS's home menu with signature
checks disabled, allowing custom code (as well
as pirated material) to be run on the 3DS.
CFW is what allows this program, among others,
to run on the 3DS.

Chances are, this 3DS is running off an EmuNAND.
Essentially, an EmuNAND is a small partition on
the SD Card of the 3DS that contains data
similar to that on the 3DS's NAND chip.  CFWs
redirect 3DS system reads to this partition
on the SD card, as opposed to the 3DS's on-
board NAND chip.  One can install games and
apps to this EmuNAND freely.

tl;dr This 3DS is modded, allowing custom
programs, as well as pirated games to be
run on it.  The 3DS's OS is also essentially
being loaded off the SD Card.

In the case you AREN'T running an EmuNAND,
proceed with caution.  Reads and writes to
the regular NAND chip on the 3DS (SysNAND)
could brick the system (render it unusable).

IF YOU AREN'T SURE WHICH NAND YOU ARE ON,
TURN THE 3DS OFF.  IF THIS IS YOUR 3DS, 
CONTACT THE PERSON WHO MODDED IT AND ASK
FOR MORE INFORMATION.  CONTINUING WITHOUT
A PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF 3DS HACKING COULD
RESULT IN A BRICK.

If this is not your 3DS, and you have no prior
knowledge of 3DS hacking, it is advised not to
run any unfamiliar programs, as doing so could
tamper the 3DS against its owner's wishes,
and/or possibly brick the system.
If this 3DS is lost, try to return
it to its original owner.

If this is your 3DS, remember to run frequent
NAND backups.  This can be achieved through
programs like EmuNAND9, which
are, more likely than not, already on this
system and can be run using a boot manager.
The button corresponding to these programs
is probably outlined on your
boot manager.  If you are still
confused, contact the person who modded
your system.

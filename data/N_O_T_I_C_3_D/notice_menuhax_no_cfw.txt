At this point, you're probably wondering: "what
on earth is wrong with this 3DS"?

The thing is, this 3DS is modded.

This 3DS is running a firmware version that
contains exploits which allow the 3DS to
run unsigned code.  This allows for
homebrew applications and emulators to
be run on the 3DS system.  However, these
exploits alone cannot enable kernel access,
which enables piracy.  Doing so requires
a kernel exploit.

tl;dr This 3DS is modded, allowing homebrew
and emulators.  Pirated games, however,
CAN NOT be installed to the system.

If this is not your 3DS, it is advised 
not to run any system updates, as 
doing so could lose access to the
exploits which enable homebrew.
If this 3DS is lost, try to return
it to its original owner.

Even if this IS your 3DS, don't run
any system updates without knowing if
exploits still work on said updates.
